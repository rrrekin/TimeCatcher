ðŸ”§ TimeCatcher Permission Fix
=============================

If TimeCatcher won't open due to security restrictions, try these solutions:

SOLUTION 1 (Easiest):
â†’ Right-click TimeCatcher.app in Applications folder
â†’ Select "Open" (instead of double-clicking)
â†’ Click "Open" in the security dialog

SOLUTION 2 (System Settings):
â†’ Go to System Settings
â†’ Select "Privacy & Security"
â†’ Scroll down to "Security" section
â†’ Click "Open Anyway" next to TimeCatcher

SOLUTION 3 (Terminal):
â†’ Open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal)
â†’ Copy and paste this command:
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/TimeCatcher.app
â†’ Press Enter

Why is this needed?
TimeCatcher is an open-source project and is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate. macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned apps by default for security.

Once you've used any of these methods once, TimeCatcher will open normally in the future.
