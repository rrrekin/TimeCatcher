# Release Workflow: Optional Enhancements

- macOS signing & notarization
  - Add Apple Developer ID signing and notarization (App Store Connect API key / keychain certs)
  - Enable hardened runtime and entitlements for Electron main/child processes
- Windows code signing
  - Sign NSIS and portable executables with a code-signing cert (EV preferred)
  - Time-stamp via a trusted TSA and verify signature in CI
- Additional Linux targets
  - Add `deb` and `rpm` targets alongside AppImage; optionally `snap`
  - Provide repository metadata or apt/yum repo hosting
- Portable/archive variants
  - Add Windows `zip` alongside `portable` for easier distribution
  - Consider macOS `.zip` (unsigned) for quick testing builds
- Auto-update pipeline
  - Configure electron-builder publish to GitHub Releases for delta updates
  - Integrate app-side auto-updater with release feed validation
- Changelog improvements
  - âœ… **Adopted Conventional Commits and generate categorized changelogs**
  - Auto-link PRs/authors/labels (completed - breaking-change sections implemented)
- Release quality gates
  - Add CI jobs for lint, unit tests, typecheck before release starts
  - Cache dependencies and build outputs to speed up pipelines
- Symbols and debug artifacts
  - Upload dSYMs (macOS) and PDBs (Windows) to a symbol server or Sentry
  - Strip binaries in release artifacts while keeping symbols separately
- Security & supply-chain
  - Set up provenance/SLSA and artifact checksums (e.g., SHA256 files)
  - Sign artifacts (e.g., minisign/cosign) and publish signatures
- Release ergonomics
  - Auto-bump version via CI input or tag-driven flow
  - Release notes templates and category sections in GitHub release
